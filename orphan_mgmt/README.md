# Orphan Management System

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The Orphan Management System is a backend project built with **Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)**.  
Its purpose is to manage orphan identity, their courses, goals, and track their progress until they achieve their dreams.  

This project is part of my **Backend Development training**.
